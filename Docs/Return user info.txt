Return user info

Google Drive provides two options to gather information about Drive users:

    Using the about resource, you can retrieve information about the user, the user's Drive settings, and their system capabilities.

    Using the apps resource, you can retrieve a list of the user's installed apps, with information about each app's supported MIME types, file extensions, and other details.

This guide explains how you can retrieve user info in Drive.
Get details about a user

To return information on a Drive user as an instance of about, use the get() method. The returned values are measured in bytes.

The get() method requires the fields parameter to list the fields to return in the response. If you omit the parameter, the method returns an error. To return the exact fields you need, see Return specific fields.
Note: If you're using the previous Drive API v2 version, setting the fields parameter in the get() method isn't required. Learn how to migrate to Drive API v3.

List user apps

Google Drive apps are listed in the Google Workspace Marketplace and are used to make Drive more convenient such as the Google Docs app or an add-on used within Docs to sign documents. For more information, see Use Google Drive apps.

To return a list of all the user's installed apps as an instance of apps, use the list() method without any parameters.

You can set the fields parameter to list the fields to return in the response. To return the exact fields you need, see Return specific fields.
Note: If you're using the previous Drive API v2 version, the response body also includes the etag field. Learn how to migrate to Drive API v3.

List user apps with query parameters

To find a specific app, use one or more of the optional query parameters:

    appFilterExtensions: Filter the search results using a comma-separated list of file extensions. Apps within the app query scope that can open the listed file extensions are included in the response. If appFilterMimeTypes are also provided, a union of the two resulting app lists is returned. Examples of extensions include docx for Microsoft Word and pptx for Microsoft PowerPoint. For more examples of file extensions, see Export MIME types for Google Workspace documents.

    The following code sample shows how to provide multiple file extensions as a query parameter: GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/apps?appFilterExtensions=docx,pptx.

    appFilterMimeTypes: Filter the search results using a comma-separated list of MIME types. Apps within the app query scope that can open the listed MIME types are included in the response. If appFilterExtensions are also provided, a union of the two resulting app lists is returned. Examples of MIME types include application/vnd.google-apps.form for Google Forms and application/vnd.google-apps.site for Google Sites. For more examples of MIME types, see Google Workspace and Google Drive supported MIME types.

    The following code sample shows how to provide multiple MIME types as a query parameter: GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/apps?appFilterMimeTypes=application/vnd.google-apps.form,application/vnd.google-apps.site.

    languageCode: Filter the search results using a language or locale code, as defined by BCP 47, with some extensions from Unicode's LDML format. Examples of language codes include en-us for English (United States) and fr-ca for French (Canada).

    The following code sample shows how to provide multiple language codes as a query parameter: GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/apps?languageCode=en-us,fr-ca.

Get user app by ID
To download the detailed app info as an instance of apps, use the get() method with the app ID.
